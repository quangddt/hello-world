# hello-world
This is my first repository that I created following the GitHub guide at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/. The guide teach us how to:
- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
- Opened and merged a Pull Request
